"""
You are given n bars of gold with weights: w1, w2, ..., wn and bag with capacity W.
There is only one instance of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not
(hence you cannot take a fraction of a bar). Write a function that returns the maximum weight of gold that fits
into a knapsack's capacity.

The first parameter contains 'capacity' - integer describing the capacity of a knapsack
The next parameter contains 'weights' - list of weights of each gold bar
The last parameter contains 'bars_number' - integer describing the number of gold bars
Output : Maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack with capacity of W.

Note:
Use the argparse module to parse command line arguments. You don't need to enter names of parameters (i. e. -capacity)
Raise ValueError in case of false parameter inputs
Example of how the task should be called:
python3 task3_1.py -W 56 -w 3 4 5 6 -n 4
